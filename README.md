Click on numbers.  Click on operators.  Get results.

### NEXT STEPS

### TO-DO LATER
- make mobile-friendly
- add keyboard inputs
- give it style
- add dark mode toggle

### DONE
- get rand working
- get x! working
- get invert working (maybe these are all a single thing)
- get % working both solo and as mid-equation operator
- figure out why "equals" works the first time, then performs the same operation on the result
- make two step operator work with result of equals instead of adding the last number
