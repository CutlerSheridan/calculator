# JavaScript Calculator
## A straightforward calculator

Click on numbers.  Click on operators.  Get results.

### NEXT STEPS
- deal with answers too long (display msg for x seconds before clearing?)
- add error message if dividing by 0

### TO-DO LATER
- make mobile-friendly
- add keyboard inputs
- give it style
- add dark mode toggle

### DONE
- fix pressing decimal after equals not keeping decimal if result was decimal
- fix decimals w/o ints operating on decimals w/o ints ~~not returning result~~ not _displaying_ result
- round long decimal answers
- add ability after "equals" to just type a new number to start fresh
- get backspace working if it's an equals result
- get rand working
- get x! working
- get invert working (maybe these are all a single thing)
- get % working both solo and as mid-equation operator
- figure out why "equals" works the first time, then performs the same operation on the result
- make two step operator work with result of equals instead of adding the last number
